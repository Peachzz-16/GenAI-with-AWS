# GenAI-with-AWS
First LLM model.


# Intermediate Cloud Project: Multi-Tier Web Application

## Objective
Build a multi-tier web application using AWS services, incorporating front-end, back-end, and database components. Implement security measures and deploy the application in a scalable manner.

## Technologies and Services Used
- **Front-end:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - React.js or Angular

- **Back-end API:**
  - Node.js or Python (Flask/Django)
  - AWS Lambda, API Gateway

- **Database:**
  - Amazon RDS (MySQL or PostgreSQL)

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Amazon Cognito, JWT

- **Storage:**
  - Amazon S3, DynamoDB

- **Networking:**
  - Amazon VPC, security groups, network ACLs

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Amazon CloudWatch

## Project Steps

1. **Design the Architecture:**
   - Plan the architecture of your application, defining components and interactions.

2. **Set Up AWS Account:**
   - Create an AWS account and set up CLI and SDK.

3. **Front-end Development:**
   - Develop a responsive front-end using React.js or Angular.
   - Integrate with Amazon S3 for static content.

4. **Back-end Development:**
   - Build serverless functions with AWS Lambda.
   - Configure API Gateway for API management.
   - Implement authentication and authorization using Amazon Cognito.

5. **Database Configuration:**
   - Set up Amazon RDS with MySQL or PostgreSQL.
   - Connect the back-end API to the database.

6. **Storage Configuration:**
   - Utilize Amazon S3 for static content storage.

7. **Networking and Security:**
   - Configure Amazon VPC for resource isolation.
   - Implement security groups, network ACLs, and enable HTTPS.

8. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics.
   - Implement logging for API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS.

9. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing, including load testing.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the application on AWS.
    - Implement CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline.

11. **Documentation:**
    - Create documentation with architecture diagrams and deployment steps.

12. **Optimization and Scaling:**
    - Optimize for cost-effectiveness.
    - Implement auto-scaling for resources.

13. **Security Review:**
    - Conduct a security review and make adjustments as needed.

14. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Conduct UAT with stakeholders and gather feedback.

15. **Maintenance and Monitoring:**
    - Establish ongoing monitoring and maintenance procedures.
    - Regularly update dependencies and review security measures.
